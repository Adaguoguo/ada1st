 Tencent QQ, popularly known as QQ, is an instant messaging software service developed by Chinese company Tencent Holdings Limited. As of January 2015, there are 829 million active QQ accounts, with a peak of 176.4 million simultaneous online QQ users.
 
 This application was first released in China in February 1999 under the name of OICQ. After the threat of a trademark infringement lawsuit by the AOL-owned ICQ, the name of the product was changed to QQ.
 QQ was first released as a "network paging" real-time communications ser vice. Now, QQ offers more services, such as online social games, music, shopping, microblogging, movies, platform of games and group and voice chat and so on.
 
 Though it has already existed for quite a few years, to meet the new demands of people, QQ still needs to further improve some of its functions. QQ has released 4 kinds of client application: the client application for smartphone, for computer, for tablet, and for website. Now that for me, the first one is more frequently used, I gonna talk about some points that need to be perfected.

 1. The cache of the application.
 The client application for smartphone often takes internal storage measured by gigabytes, this can be a burden for most phones. Even if there do exists some options in the setting part of this app to clean up the caches: to empty the chatting list, to empty all chatting history or to empty all caches, they are not practical enough. Emptying the chatting list will not help people save the storage, emptying all chatting history will make it impossible for domestic consumer to download it again (Tencent has pushed out a VIP system, which costs 10 RMB per month to be a VIP user, and 20 RMB to be a SuperVIP, the former can keep their chatting history of the resent 30 days uploaded to internet and able to be downloaded, and the latter can keep that of the recent 2 years.), and emptying all the caches will not only clean up the chatting history, but also clean up the caches of Qzone in the app.
 It is not hard to find out the differences between the last two options. QQ makes it impossible to empty caches of Qzone only, and this is what it needs to improve. Qzone is quite similar with blogging, in which people often upload photos, articles or just a simple sentence to record their present feelings, doubtless how much storage it will take. Thus, having an option to clean up the caches of Qzone will significantly help.
 2. Imparticipable of the collected QQ expression (手机QQ收藏表情的不可共享性)
 If one logs out his account and deletes it by accident, or when he uses another client app, or when he changes his phone, the collected QQ expression will no longer exist. As compared to, Wechat has pushed out a function to upload one’s collected expression. To better improve the user experience, QQ should add the same function as Wechat does.
 3. The same self-introduction when adding a new contact （添加联系人时相同的验证信息）
 When adding a new contact, the message you sent to the last newly-added contact will be displayed in the dialog box as well, this is the default of the system. This makes it inconvenient for users because we often need to delete all the words and write a new one. People have different self-introduction to different people according the position and the relationship between them. Sometimes we tend to be polite, sometimes humorous, and sometimes serious. Therefore, it will be better if the acquiescent self-introduction is cancelled.
 QQ has existed for 16 years; it’s almost as old as I am. Needless to say, its functions are quite perfect and can greatly meet people’s demand. So, that’s all I want to say about this app.
